          <h1>Weather App</h1>
          <p>
            This weather app is a straightforward tool that allows users to
            quickly check the current weather for any city they enter. It pulls
            live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the most
            essential weather details in a clean, easy-to-read layout. Designed
            to be fast and functional, this app focuses on delivering the
            information users care about most without unnecessary complexity.
            Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app served as a
            great project for practicing API integration and working with
            asynchronous data. I used JavaScript's fetch() method to connect to
            the OpenWeatherMap API and update the DOM dynamically based on the
            user's search. When the user submits a new city, the previous data
            is cleared, and the new information is loaded instantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a user enters a city name, the app fetches and displays the
            temperature, wind speed, and humidity for that location. These core
            elements are presented clearly, with units that make sense for
            general users. The layout ensures that even users on small screens
            or mobile devices can easily find what they’re looking for without
            having to scroll or dig through menus.
