          Hey! Iâ€™m Travisâ€”a web developer who loves building cool stuff with
          code. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript just messing around
          with simple projects and seeing how things worked. Over time, Iâ€™ve
          gotten better at structuring pages, writing logic, and making things
          look and feel good on the web. Iâ€™ve even picked up React to take my
          projects to the next level. But coding isnâ€™t all I do. Iâ€™m also really
          into fitnessâ€”I've been going to the gym for a few years and Iâ€™ve made
          some serious progress with building strength and muscle. On top of
          that, I recently started training in Jiu-Jitsu, which has been a great
          challenge both mentally and physically. It keeps me disciplined and
          helps me stay sharp. Outside of that, I love music and play
          guitarâ€”especially stuff from artists like Juice WRLD and The Kid
          LAROI. Itâ€™s a great creative outlet and another way I like to express
          myself. This portfolio is a place to show what Iâ€™ve been working on,
          where Iâ€™ve come from, and what Iâ€™m passionate about. Whether itâ€™s
          through code, training, or music, Iâ€™m always looking to improve and
          learn. Feel free to check out my projects and shoot me a message if
          you want to connect!
