          <h1>Work Day Scheduler</h1>
          <p>
            The Work Day Scheduler is a simple, easy-to-use calendar app
            designed to help you organize your workday from 9 AM to 5 PM. Each
            time block represents an hour of the day and includes a text area
            where you can write down tasks or reminders. Once you enter your
            plans, you can click the save icon on the right to store your
            schedule directly in your browser using localStorage. This way, your
            events stay saved even if you refresh the page or close the tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the main features of the app is the color-coded time blocks.
            Each block changes color based on the current time: • Gray shows
            past hours • Red highlights the current hour • Green marks upcoming
            hours This visual layout helps you quickly see what’s already
            happened, what you’re working on now, and what’s next. It’s
            especially useful for staying on track throughout a busy day.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built this app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a great
            exercise in working with the DOM, handling real-time data with
            JavaScript, and applying logic to dynamically update the page based
            on the current time. I also used Moment.js to manage and format the
            time data cleanly.
