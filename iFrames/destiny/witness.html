      <h1>How to Beat the Witness in Destiny 2</h1>
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
      <p>
        Have 2 runners obtain glyphBreaker buff by standing in the attacks of
        the witness hands. Shoot the correct corresponding symbol to break the
        hand. Well this happens the other 4 player deal with adds and keep
        runners alive.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>
        Once glyphBreaker is obtained, the runner will go to the center plate to
        break a button on the witness. This must be done till all buttons are
        broken.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p>
        Once all buttons are broken, the witness will be stunned and the team
        will have to deal damage to the witness. You must damage on the plate
        and doge the witness attacks well dealing damage. This will be done till
        the witness recovers.
      </p>
      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <p>
        Repeat steps 1-3 till the witness is defeated. Once the witness is
        defeated, the team will be rewarded with loot and the encounter will be
        completed.
